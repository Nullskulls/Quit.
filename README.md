# Quit.

**Quit.** is a short rage platformer made in Godot 4.1 over ~10 hours.  
It's my first game. It's not meant to be fair.

## About

- Built in **Godot 4.1**
- Platformer with intentionally frustrating level design
- Minimalist, fast, no hand-holding
- No checkpoints, because you're not supposed to relax

## Controls

- **Move:** A / D or ← / →  
- **Jump:** Spacebar  

That’s all you get.

## How to Play

Download the executable and run it. No installer. No extras. Just the game.

## Notes

- Everything made from scratch
- Expect jank, but the rage is intentional
- Not on itch.io or anything — just raw and done


> Named it **Quit.** because that’s what you’ll probably do.
